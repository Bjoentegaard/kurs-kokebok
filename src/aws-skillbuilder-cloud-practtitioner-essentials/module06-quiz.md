# QUIZ Module 5 - Networking

> Q: A developer is building an application that processes large amounts of data and requires high I/O performance. After processing the data for an operation, the results are displayed to the user and do not need to be retained long-term. Unfortunately, the application's current storage solution is experiencing performance bottlenecks during peak processing times. 
> 
> How could implementing an EC2 instance store improve the performance of the application?
> 
> A: EC2 instance store provides high I/O performance for temporary storage needs.

> Q: AnyCompany Business stores a growing amount of customer data in Amazon S3. Their manager is concerned about storage costs and asks IT to implement a solution to move older data to cheaper storage. The data is frequently accessed for the first 30 days, occasionally accessed for the next 60 days, and rarely accessed after 90 days. 
> 
> What should they do in this situation to optimize costs while maintaining appropriate access to the data?
> 
> A: Create a lifecycle rule to transition objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days, transition to S3 Glacier after 90 days.

> Q: Which statement BEST describes S3 Lifecycle?
> 
> A: A feature used to define rules to automatically transition objects between different storage classes, or delete them based on age or usage patterns.
