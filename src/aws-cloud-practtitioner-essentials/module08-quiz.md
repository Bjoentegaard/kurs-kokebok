# Module 8 - AI/ML and Data Analytics

> Q: Machine learning (ML) is a type of AI for training machines to perform complex tasks without explicit instructions. This training process involves finding patterns in vast amounts of historical data. 
> 
> What is produced as a result of the ML training process?
> 
> A: An ML model that can make predictions or decisions

> A: Amazon SageMaker AI

> Q: A team of machine learning (ML) engineers is developing a new ML model for a highly specialized application. They need complete control over the ML training process. So, they are developing their own custom solution using the PyTorch ML framework. 
> 
> What is an ML framework?
> 
> A: A software library with pre-built, optimized components

> Q: Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by extremely large ML models that are pre-trained on vast collections of data. 
> 
> What are these models called?
> 
> A: Foundation models

> Q: Data pipelines are automated assembly lines used to make the ETL process efficient and repeatable. 
> 
> What does ETL stand for?
> 
> A: Extract, transform, load

> Q: In the field of data analytics, analysts transform raw historical data into something useful. 
> 
> What are these analysts working to uncover with this transformed data?
> 
> A: Valuable insights and trends

## ASSESSMENT

> Q: The extract, transform, load (ETL) process is often used to provide clean and accessible data in a format that is usable by analytics tools and AI algorithms. 
> 
> How does a data pipeline improve this process?
> 
> A: Data pipelines make the ETL process more efficient and repeatable.

> Q: A large healthcare organization wants to improve employee productivity. The company is searching for a pre-built generative AI assistant that can answer questions, help solve problems, and take actions using the data and expertise found in its information repositories. 
> 
> Which AWS service would work well for this use case?
> 
> A: Amazon Q Business

> Q: Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that was specifically designed for working with large foundation models (FMs) and building generative AI applications. 
> 
> What does the service provide to access FMs from Amazon and leading AI startups?
> 
> A: A single API ??????

> Q: Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by extremely large machine learning (ML) models known as foundation models (FMs). 
> 
> What are characteristics of FMs? (Select TWO.)
> 
> A: FMs can be adapted to perform multiple tasks. / FMs are pre-trained on vast collections of data.

> Q: Which AWS service can be used to build, train, and deploy a customized machine learning (ML) model without worrying about the underlying infrastructure?
> 
> A: Amazon SageMaker AI

> Q: Both classical programming and machine learning can be used to train computers to perform tasks. 
> 
> What is the main difference between the two approaches?
> 
> A: Classical programming creates explicit rules for the computer to follow. In machine learning, computers make predictions using patterns learned from historical data. 

> Q: An e-commerce company wants to add a product recommendation engine to its online application to increase sales. The development team wants the recommendations to be relevant for each individual customer.
>
> Which pre-built AWS AI service would work well for this use case?
> 
> A: Amazon Personalize

> Q: A financial services company is developing an application to analyze real-time stock data so its team of analysts can make immediate trading decisions. The company needs to ingest real-time stock market data without worrying about servers or scaling capacity. 
> 
> Which AWS service would meet their needs?
> 
> A: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

> Q: A small development team is looking to add a feature to its application that converts text to speech. 
> 
> Which pre-built AWS AI service can be used for this task?
> 
> A: Amazon Polly

> Q: Data can come from many different sources. To provide insights, the data must be consolidated in a single location. There are two storage options for this. Data lakes store vast amounts of raw data, and data warehouses are optimized for business intelligence. 
> 
> Which AWS services are typically used as a data lake and data warehouse?
> 
> A: Amazon S3 is a popular choice for data lakes, whereas Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse service.
