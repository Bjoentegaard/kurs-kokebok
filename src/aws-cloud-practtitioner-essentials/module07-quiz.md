# Module 7 - Databases

> Q: AnyCompany Logistics is growing and expanding their online platform. The development team must choose between two database options. They can host their own database on an Amazon EC2 instance or use AWS's fully managed database service. The company wants to reduce IT maintenance tasks so their staff can focus more on development work. 
> 
> Which option should they choose?
> 
> A: Choose a managed database service, because the team wants to focus on developing new features rather than database administration tasks.

> Q: AnyCompany Retail wants to migrate its product database to the AWS Coud to reduce operational overhead. Their existing database contains critical inventory and pricing information that requires continuous operation with minimal downtime. Management is exploring Amazon RDS as a way to reduce the number of IT resources. 
> 
> Which feature of Amazon RDS addresses the database requirements described in this scenario?
> 
> A: Multi-AZ deployments

> Q: AnyCompany Financial is experiencing slow response times with their current MySQL database during peak transaction periods. It processes over 100,000 transactions per hour and requires high throughput for customer satisfaction. The CTO is looking at Amazon Aurora as a way to significantly improve database performance. 
> 
> Which Aurora feature BEST addresses this scenario?
> 
> A: Aurora provides a high-performance, highly available storage architecture that offers up to five times the throughput of standard MySQL.

---

> Q: A staffing resource company is building an application that must store employee information with unpredictable traffic patterns. Their application requires consistent performance at all times, and the development team wants to focus on features rather than database management tasks. 
> 
> Which Amazon DynamoDB capability BEST addresses the needs for this workload?
> 
> A: Auto scaling with provisioned capacity

---

> Q: Which problem does Amazon ElastiCache solve?
> 
> A: Performance bottlenecks due to high latency and throughput constraints

> Q: What is the main problem that can be solved by implementing AWS Backup?
> 
> A: Fragmented backup approaches across different AWS services

> Q: What is a primary feature of Amazon DocumentDB?
> 
> A: MongoDB compatibility

> Q: What is a benefit of using Amazon Neptune?
> 
> A: Low-latency queries on highly connected data

## ASSESSMENT

> Q: What is a practical use case for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)?
> 
> A: Storing and managing a large product catalog for an ecommerce application

> Q: What is the primary way that NoSQL databases like Amazon DynamoDB differ from relational databases?
> 
> A: NoSQL databases use flexible schema designs rather than the rigid table structures of relational databases.

> Q: Which statement describes the responsibilities of customers using fully managed AWS database services?
> 
> A: Customers are responsible for designing data structures and managing access controls.

> Q: Which explanation BEST describes Amazon RDS?
> 
> A: A fully managed service that helps set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud

> Q: What is a feature of AWS Backup?
> 
> A: AWS Backup provides centralized backup policies and monitoring across multiple AWS accounts and Regions.

> Q: What is a possible use case for Amazon Aurora?
> 
> A: Replacing high-cost commercial database engines with a more cost-effective solution that still provides enterprise-level performance and reliability ????

> Q: Which problem does AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) solve?
> 
> A: Minimizing application downtime during database migrations

> Q: Which definition BEST describes in-memory caching?
> 
> A: A cloud-based service that stores data in memory for fast access, improving application performance and scalability while reducing database load

> Q: Which definition BEST describes in-memory caching?
> 
> A: A cloud-based service that stores data in memory for fast access, improving application performance and scalability while reducing database load

> Q: Which option describes a scenario where an unmanaged solution like a database installed directly onto an Amazon EC2 instance would be preferable to using a fully managed AWS database service?
> 
> A: A developer needs full control over the database and access to its underlying operating system, database installation, and configuration.

> Q: What is a primary benefit of using Amazon ElastiCache?
> 
> A: Improved application performance through in-memory caching

> Q: What is a practical use of Amazon Neptune?
> 
> A: Managing and querying highly connected datasets efficiently

> Q: Which statement BEST describes Amazon DynamoDB?
> 
> A: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL key-value and document database that provides fast, predictable performance with seamless scalability.
