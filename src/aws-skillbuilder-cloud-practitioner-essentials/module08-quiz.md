> What is an ML framework?
> 
> A: A software library with pre-built, optimized components

> Q: Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by extremely large ML models that are pre-trained on vast collections of data. 
> 
> What are these models called?
> 
> A: Foundation models

## ASSESSMENT

> Q: The extract, transform, load (ETL) process is often used to provide clean and accessible data in a format that is usable by analytics tools and AI algorithms. 
> 
> How does a data pipeline improve this process?
> 
> A: Data pipelines make the ETL process more efficient and repeatable.

> Q: A large healthcare organization wants to improve employee productivity. The company is searching for a pre-built generative AI assistant that can answer questions, help solve problems, and take actions using the data and expertise found in its information repositories. 
> 
> Which AWS service would work well for this use case?
> 
> A: Amazon Q Business

> Q: Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that was specifically designed for working with large foundation models (FMs) and building generative AI applications. 
> 
> What does the service provide to access FMs from Amazon and leading AI startups?
> 
> A: A single API ??????

> Q: Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by extremely large machine learning (ML) models known as foundation models (FMs). 
> 
> What are characteristics of FMs? (Select TWO.)
> 
> A: FMs can be adapted to perform multiple tasks. / FMs are pre-trained on vast collections of data.

> Q: Which AWS service can be used to build, train, and deploy a customized machine learning (ML) model without worrying about the underlying infrastructure?
> 
> A: Amazon SageMaker AI

> Q: Both classical programming and machine learning can be used to train computers to perform tasks. 
> 
> What is the main difference between the two approaches?
> 
> A: Classical programming creates explicit rules for the computer to follow. In machine learning, computers make predictions using patterns learned from historical data. 

> Q: An e-commerce company wants to add a product recommendation engine to its online application to increase sales. The development team wants the recommendations to be relevant for each individual customer.
>
> Which pre-built AWS AI service would work well for this use case?
> 
> A: Amazon Personalize

> Q: A financial services company is developing an application to analyze real-time stock data so its team of analysts can make immediate trading decisions. The company needs to ingest real-time stock market data without worrying about servers or scaling capacity. 
> 
> Which AWS service would meet their needs?
