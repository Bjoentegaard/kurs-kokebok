# QUIZ Module 5 - Networking

> Q: What are the uses of a subnet in an Amazon VPC? (Select THREE.)
>
> A: Can be used to share public resources / Can be used to isolate resources and keep them private / Can be used to organize your resources

---

> Q: A company is setting up their Amazon VPC. They need to connect their corporate data center through the internet with a secure connection. They also want to make sure the resources are isolated from the public. 
> 
> Which solution would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A:  A virtual private gateway with a VPN connection and a private subnet in the Amazon VPC

---

> Q: A company is conducting a large-scale migration of their on-premises data center with their data warehouse and data backup. They need a solution that will meet the large amount of bandwidth requirements during migration. The solution will also be used for their ongoing data transfers after the move because they will retain part of their on-premises data center for a hybrid cloud solution. 
> 
> Which AWS solution would best meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Direct Connect link to their on-premises network and the AWS Cloud

> Q: A company is choosing the type of gateway for their network. They need to connect their corporate data center with their private subnet in their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. Their gateway needs to allow only protected internet traffic to enter into the Amazon VPC. It should also allow a connection between their Amazon VPC and a private network only if it is coming from an approved network. 
> 
> Which type of gateway would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: Virtual private gateway

---

> Q: A retail customer is setting up their application in the AWS Cloud. The application requires a lot of control in defining traffic rules for the individual Amazon EC2 instances in their public subnet. 
> 
> Which solution would BEST meet the requirements for securing the resources?
>
> A: Set up security groups for the EC2 instances based on the application requirements.

> Q: Which network component performs stateless packet filtering?
>
> A: Network access control list (network ACL)

---

> Q: An enterprise customer with a worldwide sales force is looking to deliver their large library of sales training content. They want to make sure their sales force can access the media-rich training content with low latency and reduced costs. 
> 
> Which AWS service would BEST fit the customer's need?
>
> A:  Amazon CloudFront

> Q: After years of working with different domain registration companies, a media company is looking for a solution to manage all their existing domain names. They also want to register new domain names. Ideally, they would like to manage all their domain names in a single service. 
> 
> Which AWS service would BEST fit the customer's need?
>
> A: Amazon Route 53

---

> Q: A healthcare company is looking to create a dedicated network connection to AWS. They would use this connection for their heavy payloads of data being sent over the internet to AWS. They also have compliance requirements due to the sensitive nature of their patient data. 
> 
> Which type of connection to the AWS Cloud would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Direct Connect connection from their corporate data center to a virtual private gateway in their VPC in the AWS Cloud

## ASSESSMENT


> Q: What is the primary function of a domain name service (DNS)?
>
> A: It translates human-readable domain names to machine readable IP addresses.

> Q: A customer is creating an Amazon VPC for their application. They want to create a private segment in the Amazon VPC so that resources launched can be isolated from users on the internet. 
> 
> Which network component would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: A private subnet

> Q: A financial customer needs a content delivery solution to deliver required training videos and static content to their financial consultants worldwide. They want to make sure the solution provides low latency. 
> 
> Which AWS solution would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: Amazon CloudFront

> Q: An enterprise customer just merged with another company and needs a way to quickly scale and provide a way for the new worldwide sales force to access their AWS resources. They want a fully managed service with advanced authentication for their new remote workers. 
> 
> Which solution would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Client VPN

> Q: What is networking in the AWS Cloud?
>
> A: Interconnected devices that can exchange data and resources????

> Q: A customer is exploring solutions to establish secure, encrypted connections between their on-premises networks at their data centers and branch offices. They are looking for the MOST cost-effective way to connect their office sites to other sites and their AWS services. They are not looking to increase the amount of bandwidth. 
> 
> Which solution would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Site-to-Site VPN

> Q: A customer is creating their application resources in their virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets. They want to secure their resources in the cloud, specifically the networking traffic protection tasks. 
> 
> Which component is the customer responsible for, based on the shared responsibility model?
>
> A: Securing network traffic with the subnets and resources with Network access control lists (network ACLs) and security groups

> Q: What is the primary function of an Availability Zone in the AWS Cloud?
>
> A: It enhances application availability and fault tolerance by allowing resources to be deployed across multiple zones.

> Q: A customer wants a way to establish a dedicated connection from their on-premises network to an Amazon VPC. They need a solution that provides a more consistent network experience with increased bandwidth. 
> 
> Which type of connection to the AWS Cloud would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Direct Connect

> Q: A retail customer is hosting their application in an Amazon VPC and wants to configure traffic rules for the Amazon EC2 instances running in a public subnet. The application requires multiple rules to be defined at the instance level. 
> 
> Which solution or feature would meet their needs?
>
> A: Set up security groups for the Amazon EC2 instances based on the application requirements.

> Q: A company wants to establish a secure, private connection between their on-premises data center and their Amazon VPC to create a hybrid cloud architecture. 
> 
> Which component should they use to help ensure a secure connection?
>
> A: Virtual private gateway
> 
> _A virtual private gateway is the virtual private network (VPN) endpoint on the AWS side. It provides a way for you to establish a secure, encrypted connection between your on-premises network and your virtual private cloud (VPC)._

> Q: A customer is moving their application to an Amazon VPC and wants to setup a traffic control at the subnet level. They need broad control of traffic in and out and would like to use both allow and deny type rules. 
> 
> Which solution or feature would meet their needs?
>
> A: Use network access control lists (network ACLs).

> Q: A customer is exploring edge networking services to improve application availability, performance, and security. They need a solution for traffic routing when something goes wrong in one of their application's locations. Specifically, it takes into account the endpoint health, user location, and policies. 
> 
> Which AWS solution would BEST meet their needs?
>
> A: AWS Global Accelerator

> Q: A media company needs a service to manage their domain registrations with different providers. They will also be using the service to route internet traffic to their resources hosted both in the AWS Cloud and elsewhere. 
>
